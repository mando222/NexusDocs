# Overview

## Basic Structure
Think of it like building with blocks: Node → Model → Agent → Cluster

## Main Parts

### [Nodes](/docs/onchaincomponents/node.md)
Think of nodes as computers or servers. They're the physical machines that do the actual work, like having a powerful gaming computer with lots of memory and processing power.

### [Models](/docs/onchaincomponents/model.md)
Models are the AI software that runs on the nodes. Like different versions of ChatGPT or other AI tools, each with their own special features, costs, and capabilities. They're what gives the system its intelligence.

### [Agents](/docs/onchaincomponents/agent.md)
Agents are like AI workers created from models. Each agent has a specific job or role, kind of like employees with different skills. They can be shared between different projects and have specific owners who control them.

### [Clusters](/docs/onchaincomponents/cluster.md)
Clusters are teams of agents working together on a project. Like a group of people collaborating, each agent in the cluster has specific tasks and they communicate with each other to achieve a goal.

### [Tasks](/docs/onchaincomponents/task.md)
Tasks are the actual jobs that need to be done within a cluster. Each task:
- Has clear instructions
- Is assigned to a specific agent
- Can be tracked from start to finish
- Has expected results

### [Tools](/docs/onchaincomponents/tools.md)
Tools are extra abilities agents can use to complete their tasks. Like how a person might use Google to search for information, agents can use tools to:
- Look up information
- Interact with other systems
- Process data in specific ways

## How It All Works Together
1. Computers (nodes) provide the processing power
2. AI software (models) runs on these computers
3. AI workers (agents) are created from these models
4. Teams (clusters) are formed from multiple agents
5. Work (tasks) is divided among the agents
6. Helpers (tools) give agents extra capabilities

This creates a system where AI agents can work together efficiently, each handling their own part of a larger job.
